NetICS: Network-based integration of multi omics data for prioritizing cancer genes

contact: christos.dimitrakopoulos@bsse.ethz.ch

NetICS performs a per sample bidirectional network diffusion technique to prioritize genes based on their proximity to genetically aberrant genes and differentially expressed genes. It provides a rank aggregation technique for integrating the sample-specific gene lists into an overall ranked list of genes.
